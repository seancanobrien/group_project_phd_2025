Given a group $G$, generated by a subset $S \subseteq G$, we may construct a space on which the group acts freely and transitively, namely its Cayley graph.
In this sense, all groups are (a subgroup of) a symmetry group of a space.
Fixing a group $G$, we may have many such spaces $X$ and actions $G \acts X$  which we may use to reason about the group $G$.
Broadly, geometric group theory involves exploring spaces that encode information about groups in this way.
If we restrict our study to finitely presented groups, the spaces that often turn out to be useful are those that can be defined in a discrete, procedural way, such as CW complexes, simplicial complexes, or graphs.
