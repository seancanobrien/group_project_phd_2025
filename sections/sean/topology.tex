\subsection{The classifying space of a complex of groups}
We have already discussed how to create spaces from scwols.
In fact, we may view scwols as a discrete model of such spaces.
We now work to define a space related to a complex of groups.
The fundamental group of this space can be computed directly from the algebraic structure of the complex of groups.
