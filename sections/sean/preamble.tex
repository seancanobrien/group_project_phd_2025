In this section we will introduce the construction of \emph{complexes of groups}, largely due to Haefliger \cite{haefliger_complexes_1991a}.
This generalises the construction of graphs of groups due to Bass and Serre, discussed in REF.
A related construction of \emph{triangles of groups} was studied by Gersten and Stallings \cite{stallings_nonpositively_1991} and complexes of groups were studied in two dimensions, independently of Haefliger, by Corson \cite{corson_complexes_1992}.

The construction of graphs of groups arose by abstracting emergent features of group actions on trees.
Analogously, to define complexes of groups, we will consider certain group actions on geometric complexes associated to so-called \emph{small categories without loops}.
However, unlike with graphs of groups, not every complex of groups can be realised as a quotient of group action on a complex.
