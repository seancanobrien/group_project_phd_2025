\subsection{Complexes of groups}
We will now define complexes of groups.
These will be a generalisation of graphs of groups and that theory can be recovered by realising graphs as scwols, exactly as in \cref{eg:K3_scwol}.
To motivate this construction, we will recall that graphs of groups emerge from actions of groups on trees.
Complexes of groups \emph{sometimes} emerge from an action of a group on a scwol, such a complex of groups is called \emph{developable}.
The general definition of a complex of groups abstracts the properties of developable complexes of groups.
To motivate these properties, we will consider first the construction of a complex of groups associated to an action.

Given a group $G$, a scwol $\catx$, and an action as in \cref{def:action_of_groups_on_scwols}, we can consider
