\subsection{Complexes of groups}
We will now define complexes of groups.
These will be a generalisation of graphs of groups and that theory can be recovered by realising graphs as scwols, exactly as in \cref{eg:K3_scwol}.
To motivate this construction, we will recall that graphs of groups emerge from actions of groups on trees.
Complexes of groups \emph{sometimes} emerge from an action of a group on a scwol, such a complex of groups is called \emph{developable}.
The general definition of a complex of groups abstracts the properties of developable complexes of groups.
We will first give the abstract definition of a complex of groups, then, to motivate these properties, we will define the construction of a complex of groups associated to an action.
Given a group $G$, let $\ad(g) \colon G \to G$ denote conjugation, $\ad(g)(h) = g^{-1}hg$.

\begin{definition}
	Given a scwol $\catx$, A complex of groups $G(\catx)$ over $\catx$ consists of the following data.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A group $G_\sigma$ for each $\sigma \in V(\catx)$.
		\item An injective homomorphism $\phi_a \colon G_{i(a)} \to G_{t(a)}$ for each $a \in E(\catx)$.
		\item An element $g_{a,b} \in G_{t(a)}$ for each composable pair $(b,a) \in E^{(2)}(\catx)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	The groups $G_\sigma$ are called \emph{local groups}, and the $\phi_a$ are called \emph{edge homomorphisms}.
	The elements $g_{a,b}$ are called \emph{twisting elements}.
	These twisting elements must satisfy the following compatibility conditions.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\ad(g_{a,b}) \phi_{ab} = \phi_a \phi_b$.
		\item $\phi_a(g_{b,c})g_{a,bc} = g_{a,b}g_{ab,c}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	We call a complex of groups \emph{simple} if all the twisting elements are the identity.
	\label{def:complex_of_groups}
\end{definition}

Note that compatibility condition (1) is vacuous if the dimension of $\catx$ is less than 2.
Compatibility condition (2) is vacuous if the dimension of  $\catx$ is less than 3.
Compatibility condition (1) states that, up to conjugation by a twisting element, we can compose homomorphisms along composable edges in the obvious way.
Then in this context, compatibility condition (2) states that this composition is associative.
To see this, we will use the following diagram.

\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		G_\sigma \ar[r, "\phi_c"] \ar[rr, bend left, "\phi_{bc}"] & G_\tau \ar[r, "\phi_b"] \ar[rr, bend right, "\phi_{ab}"'] & G_\mu \ar[r, "\phi_a"] & G_\nu
	\end{tikzcd}
	.\]
We could compose $\phi_a\phi_b\phi_c$ as $(\phi_a\phi_b)\phi_c$ or $\phi_a(\phi_b\phi_c)$.
Applying compatibility condition (1), the first composition is $(\ad(g_{a,b})\phi_{ab})\phi_c$ we then apply (1) again to get
\[
	(\phi_a\phi_b)\phi_c = \ad(g_{a,b})\ad(g_{ab,c})\phi_{abc} = \ad(g_{a,b}g_{ab,c})\phi_{abc}
	.\]
Similarly, with the second composition, we get
\[
	\phi_a(\phi_b\phi_c) = \phi_a\ad(g_{b,c})\phi_{bc} = \ad(\phi_a(g_{b,c}))\phi_a\phi_{bc} = \ad(\phi_a(g_{b,c})g_{a,bc})\phi_{abc}
	.\]
Without any knowledge of the group $G_\nu$, in order to guarantee associativity of composition, we require compatibility condition (2).

We now define a complex of groups associated to an action.
In some sense, this is the natural context of complexes of groups and motivates  \cref{def:complex_of_groups}.
It is in fact true that we can fully recover $G$, $\catx$ and the action from this information, but this is something we will not discuss.
See REF for more details.
\begin{definition}
	Suppose we have $\catx$, $G$, $G \backslash \catx$ and $p \colon G \to G \backslash \catx$ as described after \cref{def:action_of_groups_on_scwols}.
	Denote the scwol $G \backslash \catx$ by $\caty$.
	Let $s \colon V(\caty) \to V(\catx)$ be a section (as sets) of $p|_{V(\catx)}$.
	The complex of groups over the scwol $\caty$ associated to the action of $G$, denoted $G(\caty)$ is defined as follows.
	We define the local groups of $G(\caty)$ as the stabilisers under this section, $G_\sigma \coloneq \stab(s(\sigma))$.
	Since $p$ is non-degenerate, for each $a \in E(\caty)$ with $i(a) = \sigma$, there exists a unique $\tilde{a} \in E(\catx)$ such that $i(\tilde{a}) = s(\sigma)$ and $p(\tilde{a}) = a$.
	However, there is no guarantee that $t(\tilde{a}) = s(t(a))$.
	Choose some $h_a \in G$ such that $h_a \cdot t(\tilde{a}) = s(t(a))$.
	Do this for every edge in $E(\caty)$.
	We define the edge homomorphisms of $G(\caty)$ as $\phi_a \coloneq \ad(h_a^{-1})$.
	We define the twisting elements of $G(\caty)$ as $g_{a,b} \coloneq h_ah_bh_{ab}^{-1}$.
\end{definition}

There is a choice involved in defining the section $s$.
Had we chosen different representatives $s^\prime(\sigma)$, the resulting  subgroup $\stab(s^\prime(\sigma))$ would be conjugate to $\stab(s(\sigma))$.

We now check that, if $g \in G_{i(a)}$, then  $\phi_a(g) \in G_{t(a)}$ as required.
Observe that $h_a^{-1} \cdot s(t(a)) = t(\tilde{a})$ by construction.
Then, because $g \in \stab(i(\tilde{a}))$, and because  $g$ acts non-degenerately,  $g \in \stab(t(\tilde{a}))$.
So  $gh^{-1} \cdot s(t(a)) = t(\tilde{a})$, so $\phi_a(g) \cdot s(t(a)) = s(t(a))$ and  $\phi_a(g) \in G_{t(a)}$.
We see that $h_a^{-1}$ is exactly the correct element to conjugate by to account for the (sometimes inevitable) fact that the section $s$ is discontinuous and maps in to multiple fundamental domains of $\catx$.

In the context above, given a well-chosen $h_a$ and some $h \in G_{i(a)}$, we see that $h^\prime_a = h_ah$, would also serve the function of $h_a$.
So, there is ambiguity in that choice.
The $g_{a,b}$ account for the fact that we if we were to compare the two guaranteed possible paths along a composable edge, then we may have (sometimes, inevitably) choosen our $h_a$ inconsistently.
This is shown in the diagram below.
